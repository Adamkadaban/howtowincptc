# Presentations

The CPTC presentations occur only in the final round and involves a team presenting a set of slides as well as the pentest report to the board.
These presentations are 10 minutes and all members are required to speak. 

## Example Presentations

Global CPTC has a few years of examples of presentations made by the final teams: https://github.com/globalcptc/report_examples

There are also several videos of these presentations on their YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@globalcptc/videos

These are excellent places to look if you want to get an idea of what the best teams do.

## How to Make a Good Presentation for CPTC

This section is primarily based on [this](http://lockboxx.blogspot.com/2021/01/cptc-better-board-presentations.html) post by Dan Borges, but also includes some comments from myself.

* Remember that your presentation should always be appropriate for the person you are speaking to. Some people want a technical presentation and others want one that discusses business risks.

* The primary goal should be to highlight overall risk
	* Make sure to mention what steps can be taken to remediate any vulnerabilities found.
	* The more specific your advice is, the better. Make sure that all recommendations apply to the company you are pentesting and show the true impact in a way that is easy to understand.

* Dress appropriately for the audience. 

* ["Keep eye contact"](https://sourque.com/blog/cptc/)

* Talk about issues in the retest as well as things that have been remediated successfully by the company.

* Most of the presentation should be about the key findings and suggested remediations

### My Views on Presentations

The following are things that most winning teams seem to include in their presentations:

* Intro of the team
* Very short description of methodology + some blurb about being holistic
* Summary of vulnerabilities found as well as of how many vulnerabilities were remediated
* Discussion of key findings
* Compliance violations and recommendations (don't go overboard here)
* Short and Long-Term recommendations for remediating vulnerabilities
* A summary of all points at the end of the presentation
* Leave around 2 minutes for questions at the end
* Cite parts of the pentest (H.2 for 2nd High vuln) in the presentation)
