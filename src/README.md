# What is CPTC?

See [here](https://cp.tc/overview) for an official description

The Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC) is an event in which teams are hired to do a simulated penetration testing engagement that includes:
1. [Pentesting](pentesting/README.md) a network
1. Doing business [injects](injects/README.md)
1. Writing a [report](reporting/README.md)
1. Giving a [presentation](presentation/README.md) (if you attend finals)

Every year, a new theme is chosen along with a fictional organization that will be pentested. 

# How to Pentest

There are a ton of resources for learning. My favorite is [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/signup?referrer=5faa1fec93143b7c608061fa), which is a cyberrange that plenty of rooms that will walk you through the entire process of an excercise and has more that will challenge you to do it on your own.
* For a more complete list of resources, take a look at the one on my GitHub: https://github.com/Adamkadaban/CTFs#resources

# How to Practice for CPTC

Of course, cyberranges like [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/), [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/hacktivities), and [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/) are great for general practice and will build on your skills well. 

However, if you and your team want more CPTC-specific practice, the CPTC VM images are available online:
