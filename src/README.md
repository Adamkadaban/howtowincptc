# What is CPTC?

See [here](https://cp.tc/overview) for an official description

The Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC) is an event in which teams are hired to do a simulated penetration testing engagement that includes:
1. [Pentesting](pentesting/README.md) a network
1. Doing business [injects](injects/README.md)
1. Writing a [report](reporting/README.md)
1. Giving a [presentation](presentations/README.md) (if you attend finals)

Every year, a new theme is chosen along with a fictional organization that will be pentested.
