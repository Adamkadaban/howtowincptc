<p>See <a href="https://cp.tc/overview">here</a> for an official description</p>
<p>The Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC) is an event in which teams are hired to do a simulated penetration testing engagement that includes:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="pentesting/index.html">Pentesting</a> a network</li>
<li>Doing business <a href="injects/index.html">injects</a></li>
<li>Writing a <a href="reporting/index.html">report</a></li>
<li>Giving a <a href="presentations/index.html">presentation</a> (if you attend finals)</li>
</ol>
<p>Every year, a new theme is chosen along with a fictional organization that will be pentested.</p>
<p>If you'd like to hear about CPTC from other people, check out the <a href="blogs/index.html">blogs</a> page!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="reporting"><a class="header" href="#reporting">Reporting</a></h1>
<p>Before and after figuring out what you want in your report, I highly recommend looking at <a href="https://github.com/juliocesarfort/public-pentesting-reports">these</a> public reports to get inspiration for formatting and findings.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-write-a-good-report"><a class="header" href="#how-to-write-a-good-report">How to Write a Good Report</a></h2>
<p>This section will cover general reporting tips that will help you write an outstanding report.</p>
<p>I've almost entirely based this section on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM-MVSe4MiA&amp;ab_channel=BlackHillsInformationSecurity">BHIS Pentest Reporting course by BB King</a> that is also available as a <a href="https://www.antisyphontraining.com/pay-what-you-can/">pay what you can course from Antisyphon Training</a>.</p>
<h3 id="general-tips"><a class="header" href="#general-tips">General Tips</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reporting should be done alongside the testing</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RAYG: Report as you go.</strong></li>
<li>This will make it easier to ensure your report is complete and that you won't forget anything when you do the report.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It can be helpful to create a pre-written database of findings that you can use and modify during a pentest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many top firms do this to save time. It will make it easier to RAYG and will let your team refine findings over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep a checklist as a reminder of what you need to get done in your report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to include what attacks did not work in a report.</p>
<ul>
<li>That way, the company you're testing knows what you didn't test (what needs further testing) and they know what they're doing well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not say "includes but is not limited to" or similar. Make sure that your lists, especially when detailing vulns and inventory, are complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report should indicate that it is confidential (or whatever other labeling term the company uses)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="report-elements"><a class="header" href="#report-elements">Report Elements</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Include evidence of <strong>all</strong> findings</p>
<ul>
<li>The evidence should make it not only easy to understand, but also hard to misunderstand.
<ul>
<li>The best way to do this is with screenshots.</li>
<li>Note that ambiguity is hard to avoid:
<ul>
<li>eg. If you type <code>whoami</code> to show root, that doesn't necessarily prove root, as it could only have euid of 0. Type <code>root; id</code> to prove that you are root.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Annotate screenshots with numbers, boxes, arrows (use flameshot)
<ul>
<li>Get a standard color used between everyone writing the report. This will make it look more professional.</li>
<li>All credentials (yes, even hashes) should be redacted.</li>
<li>Try to make sure everything in the screenshot is relevant and everything that is relevant is in the screenshot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be specific about every finding.
<ul>
<li>Explain exactly which resources under which permissions are vulnerable to what.</li>
<li>If you know something is true, explain how you know that it is true.
<ul>
<li>eg. instead of saying "this server is old", say "the http response header indicates that the server is old"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every finding must have a context behind it.</p>
<ul>
<li>How does this finding relate to the org?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every finding needs to have a business impact. Will this fix require a lot of overhead? Will it cost a lot? Explain why a fix is necessary if it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reports (especially the findings) are generally read by security people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain how problems are found so findings can be recreated.</li>
<li>This is crucial! If an org is trying to remediate the findings on their own, they have to know exactly how to check if the issues were fixed. It will also make a retest easier for you or any other testers in the future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For recommendations, include why they are so and who recommended them (links are preferable).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="visual-elements"><a class="header" href="#visual-elements">Visual Elements</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ensure that fonts and colors are consistent. Font size in images should be similar of the font size that is used in the report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preferably, screenshots will look consistent in terms of size, color, font, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tone"><a class="header" href="#tone">Tone</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In general, dismissive words like "simply", "small", "quickly" can make someone reading a report feel as if it is unimportant.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reports that are more negative are less likely to get the company rehired to do a retest.</li>
<li>People may ignore any advice given when it is given with a tone that suggests the reporter feels superior to the person it is being read by.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not brag. This can make the customer unhappy + prevent them from wanting to rehire you. Your skills should be proven by your report quality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-generate-reports"><a class="header" href="#how-to-generate-reports">How to Generate Reports</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>BHIS suggests using word as, even though it's annoying, it's the best in terms of macros + styles + sections + custom dictionary + spellcheck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With word you can have people work in separate documents and then <code>Insert &gt; Object &gt; Text</code> to insert other word docs into your main report doc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also use spellcheck as a way to quickly type big block of texts (shortcuts basically).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tools like LaTeX can also be used if you want more granular control of your template, but can make reporting a lot slower.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some clients may also specifically request a Word doc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tools like <a href="https://plextrac.com/">PlexTrac</a> can make reporting, especially when collaborative, much easier, but are very expensive.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pwndoc/pwndoc">pwndoc</a> is a great open-source alternative that works similarly to generate a word document based on findings.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/GhostManager/Ghostwriter">Ghostwriter</a> by SpecterOps is another fantastic open-source tool that works just as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Syslifters/sysreptor">SysReporter</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Writing a good report for CPTC should be about the same as writing a general report.</p>
<p>However, Dan Borges (Scoring), has written several blogs on what he believes to be critical in a pentest, which especially motivated teams may want to know to have a slight leg up on the other competition.</p>
<p>Thus, the majority of this section will be based on various posts on <a href="http://lockboxx.blogspot.com/">Dan Borges' Blog</a></p>

<h2 id="how-to-pentest"><a class="header" href="#how-to-pentest">How to Pentest</a></h2>
<p>There are a ton of resources for learning. My favorite is <a href="https://tryhackme.com/signup?referrer=5faa1fec93143b7c608061fa">TryHackMe</a>, which is a cyberrange that plenty of rooms that will walk you through the entire process of an exercise and has more that will challenge you to do it on your own.</p>
<ul>
<li>For a more complete list of resources, take a look at the one on my GitHub: https://github.com/Adamkadaban/CTFs#resources</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to get serious about pentesting, I think the <a href="https://academy.tcm-sec.com/courses/1152300">Practical Ethical Hacking Course</a> by Heath Adams is amazing. You can pay for the course on the TCM security website or can get slightly older versions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FNYvj2U0HM">for free</a> on YouTube, and sometimes on Udemy. This course aligns with a certification called the PNPT that, in my opinion, is much better than the OSCP while being much cheaper.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-practice-for-cptc"><a class="header" href="#how-to-practice-for-cptc">How to Practice for CPTC</a></h2>
<p>Of course, cyberranges like <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/">HackTheBox</a>, <a href="https://tryhackme.com/hacktivities">TryHackMe</a>, and <a href="https://www.vulnlab.com/">VulnLab</a> are great for general practice and will build on your skills well.</p>
<p>However, if you and your team want more CPTC-specific practice, the CPTC VM images are available online:

<p>As of 2023, CPTC has included Cloud with AWS or Azure/Entra in its environment. <a href="https://cloudfoxable.bishopfox.com/">Cloudfoxable</a>, <a href="https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/cloudgoat">CloudGoat</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ine-labs/Awsgoat">AWSGoat</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ine-labs/AzureGoat">AzureGoat</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ine-labs/GCPGoat">GCPGoat</a> are fantastic resources for practicing here.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="osint"><a class="header" href="#osint">OSINT</a></h1>
<p>OSINT, or open-source intelligence, is the first thing that you will do to start your pentest for CPTC.</p>
<p>This involves doing <strong>passive</strong> reconnaissance of the company that you've been hired to pentest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that doing brute-force enumeration of websites may get your team a warning and/or potentially disqualified.</li>
</ul>
<p>All information about the company is produced by the CPTC world team and is slowly published online as the competition gets closer. This means your team should be constantly reviewing previous discoveries and looking for more.</p>
<ul>
<li>In past years, teams have recorded their OSINT with <a href="https://www.maltego.com/">Maltego</a>, which can make things easier to keep track of and can also help with describing OSINT in a report.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a (partially redacted) set of slides on OSINT basics that covers tools and techniques that may be useful to you: <a href="https://hackback.zip/2024/02/01/OSINT.html">UFSIT OSINT Slides</a></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="injects"><a class="header" href="#injects">Injects</a></h1>
<p>CPTC injects involve interactions that could occur during an engagement.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell the company what pentesting standard you are using</li>
<li>Respond to an email asking about relevant compliance standards</li>
<li>Explain to the client how to make passwords better</li>
<li>Weigh in on if the client should incorporate MFA</li>
<li>Make a social engineering phone call (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmhzcebVkkM&amp;ab_channel=GlobalCPTC">This happened!</a>)</li>
<li>Make a phishing site for harvesting credentials</li>
<li>Send phishing mail via an exe or maldoc</li>
<li>Create a network diagram</li>
<li>Leak secrets from an LLM</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also possible to have injects that involve physical attacks like that of lockpicking.</p>
<p>When doing an inject, make sure to remain in character and be professional.</p>
<p>You should be responding just as an actual pentesting firm would.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are asked to disclose info about other clients/competitors or are asked to do something immoral (I'm unaware if these have ever been actual injects), you should decline and explain why.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not know the answer to something, do not pretend that you do and try your best to answer properly.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the same vein, take accountability for something if you made a mistake.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="educational-events"><a class="header" href="#educational-events">Educational Events</a></h1>
<p>This section seems to primarily be scored in the final round and essentially involves scoring a team's ability to be responsible when pentesting.</p>
<p>When pentesting for CPTC, you can't treat the network like any random HackTheBox. This means no changing a user's password, no brute-forcing, no exfiltrating sensitive data, etc.</p>
<p>Here are some things that have been scored (as negative points) in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>Running dangerous exploits without knowing what they do</li>
<li>Brute-forcing accounts and causing account lockout</li>
<li>Sending an inappropriate phishing email</li>
<li>Overloading ICS or other systems to cause a denial of service</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Some things to keep in mind:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you make a mistake, own up to it ASAP.</li>
<li>When you are told about a mistake, make sure to react appropriately and professionally.</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems that if you respond appropriately to a mistake, you can earn back up to 95% of the points you would have lost.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="presentations"><a class="header" href="#presentations">Presentations</a></h1>
<p>The CPTC presentations occur only in the final round and involves a team presenting a set of slides as well as the pentest report to the board.
These presentations are 10 minutes and all members are required to speak.</p>
<h2 id="example-presentations"><a class="header" href="#example-presentations">Example Presentations</a></h2>
<p>Global CPTC has a few years of examples of presentations made by the final teams: https://github.com/globalcptc/report_examples</p>
<p>There are also several videos of these presentations on their YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@globalcptc/videos</p>
<p>These are excellent places to look if you want to get an idea of what the best teams do.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-make-a-good-presentation-for-cptc"><a class="header" href="#how-to-make-a-good-presentation-for-cptc">How to Make a Good Presentation for CPTC</a></h2>
<p>This section is primarily based on <a href="http://lockboxx.blogspot.com/2021/01/cptc-better-board-presentations.html">this</a> post by Dan Borges, but also includes some comments from myself.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Remember that your presentation should always be appropriate for the person you are speaking to. Some people want a technical presentation and others want one that discusses business risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The primary goal should be to highlight overall risk</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to mention what steps can be taken to remediate any vulnerabilities found.</li>
<li>The more specific your advice is, the better. Make sure that all recommendations apply to the company you are pentesting and show the true impact in a way that is easy to understand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dress appropriately for the audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://sourque.com/blog/cptc/">"Keep eye contact"</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk about issues in the retest as well as things that have been remediated successfully by the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of the presentation should be about the key findings and suggested remediations</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="my-views-on-presentations"><a class="header" href="#my-views-on-presentations">My Views on Presentations</a></h3>
<p>The following are things that most winning teams seem to include in their presentations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intro of the team</li>
<li>Very short description of methodology + some blurb about being holistic</li>
<li>Summary of vulnerabilities found as well as of how many vulnerabilities were remediated</li>
<li>Discussion of key findings</li>
<li>Compliance violations and recommendations (don't go overboard here)</li>
<li>Short and Long-Term recommendations for remediating vulnerabilities</li>
<li>A summary of all points at the end of the presentation</li>
<li>Leave around 2 minutes for questions at the end</li>
<li>Cite parts of the pentest (H.2 for 2nd High vuln) in the presentation)</li>
</ul>
